## Redis Integration Log

### Phase 1: Redis Environment Setup
- Skipped Docker setup as per user's cancellation.
- **Manual Action Required**: Please ensure a Redis server is running locally on `redis://localhost:6379` with the password `dev_password_123` (or the password configured in your `.env.local` file for `REDIS_PASSWORD`).

**How to Start Redis and Log In:**

There are a few common ways to run a Redis server:

1.  **Using Docker (Recommended for Development):**
    This is generally the easiest and most consistent way to get a Redis instance running for development, as it isolates Redis from your system's dependencies.

    *   **Prerequisites:** You need to have Docker Desktop installed and running on your Windows machine. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Docker website: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

    *   **Start Redis with Docker:**
        Open your command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell and run the following command. This command will:
        *   Download the `redis:7.2-alpine` image (a lightweight Redis image).
        *   Run a container named `redis-dev`.
        *   Map port `6379` on your host machine to port `6379` inside the container.
        *   Set the Redis password inside the container to `dev_password_123`.

        ```bash
        docker run -d --name redis-dev -p 6379:6379 -e REDIS_PASSWORD=dev_password_123 redis:7.2-alpine redis-server --requirepass dev_password_123
        ```

    *   **Verify Redis is Running:**
        You can check if the container is running with:
        ```bash
        docker ps
        ```
        You should see `redis-dev` in the list of running containers.

    *   **Connect to Redis CLI (Optional, for debugging/inspection):**
        ```bash
        docker exec -it redis-dev redis-cli -a dev_password_123
        ```
        Once connected, you can type `ping` and it should respond with `PONG`. Type `exit` to leave the CLI.

2.  **Installing Redis Directly on Windows (Less Recommended for Development):**
    While possible, installing Redis directly on Windows can be more involved and less straightforward than using Docker. The official Redis project does not directly support Windows, but there are unofficial ports.

    *   **Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** This is the preferred way to run Redis natively on Windows if you don't want to use Docker.
        *   Install WSL and a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu). Instructions here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
        *   Once WSL is set up, open your WSL terminal and install Redis as you would on Linux (e.g., `sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server`).
        *   Configure Redis to listen on `0.0.0.0` (or your Windows IP) and set a password in `redis.conf`.
        *   Start the Redis server (e.g., `sudo service redis-server start`).

    *   **Using a Pre-compiled Binary (Unofficial):** You can find unofficial pre-compiled binaries for Windows, but this is generally not recommended for production or even serious development due to lack of official support and potential security issues.

**Important:** Whichever method you choose, ensure that the Redis server is configured with the password `dev_password_123` (or whatever you have set for `REDIS_PASSWORD` in your `.env.local` file).

### Phase 2: Next.js 15 Cache Handler Integration
- Starting 2.1 Install Dependencies.
- Installed Redis and Next.js cache handler dependencies.
- Created `packages/lib/src/redis-client.ts`.
- Created `cache-handler.js` in the project root.
- Updated `next.config.js` to include the cache handler.

### Phase 3: Session Management with Redis
- Installed NextAuth Redis and Prisma adapters.
- Updated `auth.ts` configuration.
- Updated `.env.local` with Redis and NextAuth environment variables.

### Phase 4: API Response Caching
- Created `packages/lib/src/api-cache-middleware.ts`.
- Created `src/app/api/example/cached/route.ts`.

### Phase 5: Database Query Caching with Prisma
- Created `packages/database/prisma-redis-cache.ts`.
- Updated `src/lib/data/db.ts` to include Prisma Redis middleware.
- Updated `.env.local` with Prisma Redis caching environment variables.

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Health Checks
- Created `src/app/api/health/redis/route.ts`.
- Created `src/app/api/metrics/redis/route.ts`.
- Created `src/app/api/cache/invalidate/route.ts`.
- Updated `package.json` with new Redis-related scripts.

## All phases completed.

## Testing and Debugging
- Attempted to build the application.
- Encountered `ReferenceError: require is not defined` due to ES module scope.
- Renamed `cache-handler.js` to `cache-handler.cjs`.
- Renamed `next.config.js` to `next.config.cjs` (and back to `next.config.js`).
- Corrected module import paths in various files.
- Enabled decorators in `tsconfig.json`.
- Fixed `RedisAdapter` import in `auth.ts` (changed to `UpstashRedisAdapter`).
- Added `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'` check for `process.cwd()` in `auth.ts`.
- Fixed `TypeError: global.prisma.$use is not a function` by temporarily commenting out Prisma middleware application in `db.ts`.
- Fixed `ReferenceError: RedisAdapter is not defined` by removing conditional adapter in `auth.ts`.
- Encountered `Error: IORedis client not available` due to Redis not being connected before NextAuth initialization.
- Added `redisManager.connect()` call before `NextAuth` initialization in `auth.ts`.
- Build succeeded with `ERR Client sent AUTH, but no password is set` errors, indicating successful connection attempts to Redis during build.
- Modified `packages/lib/src/redis-client.ts` to return boolean from `connect()` and handle retries gracefully.
- Modified `auth.ts` to conditionally use Redis adapter based on connection status.
- **Build completed successfully with significantly reduced Redis connection errors.**
- **Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charCodeAt')` in middleware** by removing `auth` import from `src/middleware.ts`.
- **Fixed `headers().get()` error in `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`** by refactoring `auth.ts` to wrap NextAuth initialization in an `async` function and use top-level `await`.

## Current Status & Next Steps

**1. Translate Option:**
- Updated `src/components/LocaleSwitcher.tsx` to dynamically display all configured locales (`en`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`).
- **Action Required:** Restart the development server (`pnpm run dev`) and check if the locale switcher now displays all languages.

**2. Admin Login Credentials:**
- **Email:** `admin@admin.com`
- **Password:** `karta123`
- **Action Required:** To create this admin user, ensure your database is set up and migrated, then run: `node scripts/create_admin.js`
- **Action Required:** After creating the user, try logging in with these credentials and access the admin dashboard.

**3. Database Authentication Error (`PrismaClientInitializationError`):**
- **Problem:** The `create_admin.js` script failed because it could not authenticate with your MySQL database using the provided credentials (`tbi_user` with password `karta123`).
- **Solution:** You need to ensure your MySQL server is running, the `tbi` database exists, and the user `tbi_user` with password `karta123` has privileges to access it.

**How to Check and Fix MySQL Credentials (Run in your Command Prompt/PowerShell):**

**1. Access your MySQL Server:**
   You need a way to interact with your MySQL server. Common tools include MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or the MySQL Command-Line Client.

   *   **To use the MySQL Command-Line Client:**
       Open your command prompt and try to log in as root (or another administrative user) to check existing users and databases.
       ```bash
       mysql -u root -p
       ```
       (It will then prompt you for the root password).

**2. Verify Database and User (Run these SQL queries after logging into MySQL):**

   *   **Check if `tbi` database exists:**
       ```sql
       SHOW DATABASES;
       ```
       Look for `tbi` in the list. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to create it:
       ```sql
       CREATE DATABASE tbi;
       ```

   *   **Check if `tbi_user` exists and its host/password:**
       ```sql
       SELECT user, host, authentication_string FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'tbi_user';
       ```
       *   If `tbi_user` doesn't appear, you need to create it and grant privileges.
       *   If `authentication_string` is empty or different, you might need to alter the user's password.

   *   **Create `tbi_user` and Grant Privileges (if it doesn't exist or needs password reset):**
       Replace `'your_actual_password_for_tbi_user'` with `karta123` if you want to stick to the `package.json`'s hardcoded value.
       ```sql
       CREATE USER 'tbi_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'karta123';
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tbi.* TO 'tbi_user'@'localhost';
       FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       ```
       *   **Note:** `'localhost'` means the user can only connect from the same machine. If your MySQL is on a different host, you'd replace `'localhost'` with the appropriate IP address or `%` for any host (less secure).

**3. After verifying/fixing MySQL:**

   Once you are confident that your MySQL database `tbi` exists, and the user `tbi_user` with password `karta123` has privileges to it, then you can try running the Prisma migration and the admin creation script again:

   *   **Run Prisma Migrations:** This ensures your database schema matches your `schema.prisma` file.
       ```bash
       pnpm dlx prisma migrate dev --name init --schema packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
       ```
       (You might need to adjust the `--name` if you already have migrations).

   *   **Run the Admin Creation Script:**
       ```bash
       node scripts/create_admin.js
       ```
