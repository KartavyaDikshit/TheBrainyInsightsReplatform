Understanding web application architecture basicsExported on 9/3/2025 at 04:00:35 GMT+5:30 from Cursor (1.5.9)---Usergo through all of these and give me a proper idea about the architechture, what is what, and what if i want to edit something like the color of a part of the title or remove any components,edit the text hardcoded in if any, what is dynamically rendered and what is staticallyi want to use this summary so that i can integrate this into my web applicationexplain everything thouroughly and be helpful to complete beginners so that i can form a mental model  of what is what and where this fits in the  web app---CursorI'll analyze the entire codebase to give you a comprehensive understanding of the architecture and how everything fits together. Let me start by examining the main entry points and key files.Now let me examine the main components to understand the structure:Now let me examine the styling files to understand the design system:Let me also check a few UI components to understand the design system:Let me also check if there are any other components that might be related to signup/forms:Now let me read the other form steps and visual panel to complete the picture:Now let me check the README to see if there are any additional details:Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me provide you with a thorough architectural overview and guide.Complete Architecture Guide: User-Friendly Sign-up Flow🏗️ High-Level ArchitectureThis is a React + TypeScript application built with Vite as the build tool. It's a modern, component-based architecture using:React 18 with hooks and functional componentsTypeScript for type safetyTailwind CSS with a custom design systemRadix UI components for accessibilityFramer Motion (via `motion`) for animationsLucide React for icons📁 Project Structure BreakdownEntry Points & Configuration```├── index.html              # HTML template, loads React app├── src/main.tsx            # React app entry point├── src/App.tsx             # Main app component (landing page layout)├── vite.config.ts          # Build configuration└── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts```Main Application Flow```src/App.tsx├── Header                  # Navigation bar├── Hero                    # Main banner with search├── CategoryGrid            # Industry categories├── ReportGrid              # Featured reports├── TrustStrip              # Client logos└── Footer                  # Links and newsletter```Signup Flow (Secondary App)```src/components/SignupFlow.tsx├── VisualStoryPanel        # Left side: rotating images/stories└── SignupFormPanel         # Right side: 3-step form    ├── ProgressIndicator   # Step progress bar    ├── FormStep1           # Personal info    ├── FormStep2           # Password & terms    └── FormStep3           # Preferences & company info```Design System```src/components/ui/          # Reusable UI components├── button.tsx              # Button variants (primary, outline, ghost, etc.)├── card.tsx                # Card container component├── input.tsx               # Text input with styling├── select.tsx              # Dropdown select├── checkbox.tsx            # Checkbox component├── textarea.tsx            # Multi-line text input└── utils.ts                # Utility function for CSS classes```Styling System```src/styles/globals.css      # CSS variables and design tokenssrc/index.css              # Tailwind imports and base styles```🎨 Design System & ThemingColor SchemeThe app uses CSS custom properties (variables) for theming:Primary color: Indigo (`#4338ca`) - used for buttons, links, accentsBackground: White with subtle grays for sectionsText: Dark gray (`oklch(0.145 0 0)`) for readabilityBorders: Light gray with transparencyTypographyFont sizes: Responsive (14px base, scales up on larger screens)Font weights: Normal (400) and Medium (500)Line height: 1.5 for readability🧩 Component ArchitectureMain Landing Page Components1.
