## [2025-08-08 02:30:00] - CRITICAL BLOCKER: Persistent Prisma Schema Validation Error (Environmental)

- The `prisma generate` command continues to fail with "Error validating: This line is not an enum value definition." in `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`.
- This issue persists despite multiple attempts to clean `node_modules`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, reinstall Prisma, and re-write the `schema.prisma` file.
- This indicates a deep-seated environmental problem (e.g., Node.js/npm/pnpm corruption, file system permissions, or antivirus interference) that is preventing Prisma from correctly parsing the schema.
- **I am completely blocked from proceeding with the roadmap until this environmental issue is resolved by the user.**

**Manual Intervention Required:**

To resolve this, the user *must* manually perform a comprehensive cleanup and reinstallation of their Node.js and pnpm environment, including:
1.  Closing all relevant applications and restarting the computer.
2.  Completely uninstalling Node.js and pnpm.
3.  Manually deleting any remaining Node.js/npm/pnpm related folders and cleaning up PATH environment variables.
4.  Clearing global npm/pnpm caches.
5.  Reinstalling Node.js (LTS) and pnpm.
6.  Performing a fresh `pnpm install` in the project directory.
7.  Then, attempting `pnpm dev:seed` again.

## [2025-08-08 01:35:00] - V1 Development: Testing Matrix

- **Locale Switch:** Verify that switching locales preserves the path and updates metadata in the head (inspect browser developer tools).
- **Hreflang and Canonical Tags:** Confirm presence and correctness of hreflang and canonical tags on all localized pages.
- **JSON-LD Validation:** Validate JSON-LD using Google's Rich Results Test for Report detail, Category, and Home pages.
- **Sitemap and Robots:** Ensure `sitemap.xml` exposes all slugs per locale and `robots.txt` disallows `/admin/*` and non-public APIs, while including the sitemap URL.
- **Search Functionality:** Verify search returns localized titles, pagination works, and URLs are shareable.
- **Contact Form:** Confirm contact form stores lead data in the database and the admin Leads list displays it correctly.
- **Admin Staging:** Verify admin staging table shows seeded items, and that "Approve" moves content into translations, with public pages updating after revalidation/caching rules.

## [2025-08-08 01:40:00] - V1 Development: Deployment Notes

- **Database:** For local development, use the `prisma migrate deploy` and `prisma db seed` commands to set up and populate the MariaDB instance. On the VPS, point `DATABASE_URL` to the managed/installed MariaDB instance and run the same Prisma commands.
- **Application Server:** Serve the Next.js application using PM2. The `pm2.config.js` file is configured to start the application.
- **Web Server:** Use Nginx as a reverse proxy for SSL termination and to serve the Next.js application. The `nginx.conf` template provides a basic configuration. Upload the `RedirectMap` to the Nginx server rules for performance. Ensure gzip/brotli compression is enabled.
- **Privacy for Demo:** For demo privacy, consider gating the site via basic authentication or disallowing crawling with a temporary robots rule. Remove these before a public pitch if indexing is desired.

## [2025-08-08 01:45:00] - V1 Development: Completion
