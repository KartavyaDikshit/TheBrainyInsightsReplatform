### 2025-08-14 [Current Time] - Phase 4: OpenAI API Integration (Staging & Approval Workflow)

**Objective:** Outline the human review and approval process for AI-generated content.

**1. Workflow Steps:**
*   **AI Generation:** Content is generated by the OpenAI API and stored in a "PENDING_REVIEW" state in the database (e.g., `AIGenerationQueue` model).
*   **Human Review Interface:** A dedicated interface (likely in the `/admin` section of the web app) will be developed for human reviewers to:
    *   View AI-generated content alongside its structural data.
    *   Edit the content for accuracy, tone, and SEO optimization.
    *   Approve or Reject the content.
*   **Approval/Rejection Action:**
    *   **Approval:** Upon approval, the content is moved from the `AIGenerationQueue` to the respective `_Translation` model (e.g., `ReportTranslation`, `BlogTranslation`), and its status is updated to "PUBLISHED".
    *   **Rejection:** Upon rejection, the content remains in `AIGenerationQueue` with a "REJECTED" status, and optionally, a reason for rejection can be added for further AI model fine-tuning or manual intervention.
*   **Status Tracking:** The `AIGenerationQueue` model will track the status of each generation request (PENDING_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED, ERROR).

**Current Status:** Phase 4: OpenAI API Integration - Staging & Approval Workflow outlined.
